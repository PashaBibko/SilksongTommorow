# Silksong Tommorow

Silksong tommorow is a small joke website, which can be found [here](https://pashabibko.github.io/SilksongTommorow/).
It uses a brute force algorithim to find any possible reason for why Silksong may be released tommorow.
This is done by finding any mathmatical sum to equal tommorow's date for example:

```
/* If the date is 18/05 it could be: */
(((15 * 2) - 63) * 47) + 1331 + 2025 = 1805
```

Each number also has a meaning. These are all of the numbers with their meaning:
